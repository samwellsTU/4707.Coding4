## Exploring Function Expressions

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of function expressions in JavaScript. You will create functions that take parameters, return values, and print to the console. The focus is on function expressions, a fundamental concept for new JavaScript developers.

### Objectives

- Write function expressions to perform specific tasks.
  - remember we are typically using this format for fucntion expressions 
  ```
  const myFunctionName = function(param, param) {
        all the code.......
        return something;
  };
  ```
- Understand the difference between functions that return values and those that print to the console.
- Use parameters effectively in functions.

### Tasks

1. **Greeting Function**: Write a function expression named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and prints the greeting `Hello, name!` to the console. 
   - note: if you give it the name `Stella` it should print `Hello, Stella!`
2. **Sum Function**: Create a function expression named `calculateSum` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.


### Testing Your Code

- We have provided a set of Jest tests in `script.test.js` to auto-grade your submission.
- Make sure your functions match the names and specifications provided to pass the tests.
- Run your tests locally before submission to ensure correctness.

### Submission

- Complete your code in the `script.js` file.
- Ensure your tests in `script.test.js` are passing with your implementations.
- Submit your repository link with the completed assignment.

Good luck, and enjoy coding with JavaScript functions!
